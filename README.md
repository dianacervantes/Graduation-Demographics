# Group Abstract: Boundaries in the Digital Humanities 
The humanities is a broad feild of study that has branched out into numerous diciplines. We are all aware that the African American studies department conducts research in Black communitites and balck issues. We also know that Women and Gender departments focus on their own communitites and have just begun scratching the surface of queer feminist theory. But as we enter the digital age we are confronted with the emerging feild of the Digital Humanities. This is a feild that marries data studies and the humanities. Though it does seem confusing since they are trying to have the broad feild of the humaniteis fit under this single dicipline. In this study we test the boundaries of the Digital Huamnitites and ask if it is ethical to have the feild of data which is mostly white and male research humanities studies without proper training. We ask, what demographics should be allowed to study what topics and if it ethical? 

This was a group effort which allowed for two different perspectives of current students of color at a high ranking UC. The collaboration was helpful since we were able to provide our own interpritations of the text and had a more critical understanding of the study. 

# Individual Abstract: College Diversity vs Grad Diversity 
You claim your university campus is diverse. But, how diverse is your graduation? As we know the UCs are the most sought after schools in califonia. With record breaking aplicants every year, they have opportinities to incude more diversity in their campuses. The question for a long time has been, how diverse are the campuses? But in this project I will ask,How are they helping under recourced students? How diverse is graduation? The research will explore the numbers across the UCs and find flaws within the system that may be holding minorities back. This project will take the demographic statistics and organize them in a way that will allow for critical analysis of the UC system. I will create statistics for every UC and for the UC system as a whole that reflect on campus numbers and the numbers at graduation. The goal of this project is to ask new questions of diversity within college campuses in order to make minority students heard.
