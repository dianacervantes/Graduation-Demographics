# Graduation-Demographics
You claim your university campus is diverse. But, how diverse is your graduation? 
As we know the UCs are the most sought after schools in califonia. With record breaking aplicants every year, they have opportinities to incude more diversity 
in their campuses. The question then becomes, how diverse are the campuses? How are they helping under recourced students? How diverse is graduation? In this 
project we will explore the numbers across the UCs and find flaws within the system that may be holding minorities back.
